Silje and Geir A's repo for the course TMA4280 Introduction to super computers


Just a repo for collaboration on the mandatory projects in the mentioned course at NTNU.
It will contain solutions to problems given by lecturer regarding paralelization techniques using OpenMP and MPI.

So, to whoever non-collaborators that is reading this, my guess is: you will find nothing of interest. Keep on walking.
